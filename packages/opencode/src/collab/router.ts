 * Register the queue executor for a collab session.
 *
 * The executor is called by _scheduleNext whenever a suggestion reaches
 * "approved" status.  Two-phase status flip:
 *
 *   1. BEFORE prompt_async — mark "in_flight".  Removes the suggestion from
 *      getApprovedQueue (so _scheduleNext won't re-pick it) AND leaves a
 *      breadcrumb on disk: "this prompt was being dispatched when the
 *      container died."
 *   2. AFTER prompt_async returns successfully — mark "submitted".  Final
 *      terminal state for the row.
 *
 * If an ECS task replacement (or any other process death) interrupts the
 * dispatch mid-stream, the row stays "in_flight" on disk.  The boot-sweep
 * inside runCollabMigrations() flips all `in_flight` rows back to
 * `approved` so the new task's executor picks them up and re-dispatches —
 * the Driver sees the LLM response start over rather than silently vanish.
 *
 * Failure path (transport error / native session offline): we log and leave
 * the row as `in_flight`.  No inline retry (would loop on a permanently
 * broken LLM); recovery happens on the next restart via the same sweep.
 *
 * This must be called:
 *   1. At session creation (POST /collab/session)
 *   2. From ensureQueueRegistered — handles server restarts where in-memory
 *      queue state is lost but DB sessions survive.
