/**
 * /preview/<port>/<rest> — HTTP + WebSocket reverse proxy.
 *
 * Lets a collab participant's browser see a dev server running INSIDE the
 * opencode container.  When the LLM (or a user via the iframe's terminal)
 * does `npm run dev` and Vite binds to 127.0.0.1:5173, others can open
 *   https://collab.unleashlive.com/preview/5173/
 * and the request gets proxied through.
 *
 * Two pieces:
 *  - {@link handlePreviewHttp} for plain HTTP requests (web-standard
 *    Request/Response) — used from the collab middleware in server.ts
 *    after it identifies the path as /preview/.
 *  - {@link attachPreviewUpgrade} for WebSocket upgrades — wired into the
 *    Node http.Server's `upgrade` event (Vite / Next HMR live here).
 *
 * Security note: the proxy targets ONLY 127.0.0.1 inside the container's
 * network namespace, so it can't reach anything else on the network.  We
 * accept any port the URL specifies — the assumption is anyone with
 * collab access has effectively shell-level trust on the workspace
 * already (they can ask the LLM to run arbitrary commands).
