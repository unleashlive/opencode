#
# Multi-stage build optimised for fast iteration during development.
#
# Layer-cache strategy:
#   1. apt deps + plugin pre-install     → stable, change rarely → top of file
#   2. manifests-only COPY → bun install → cached unless package.json/lockfile changes
#   3. full source COPY → bun run build  → only this stage re-runs on source edits
#
# Typical iteration after a source edit: only stage 3 rebuilds.
# Cold build time: ~the same.  Warm rebuild after a source-only edit: ~minutes saved.

# ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
# Stage 1 — extract only the files `bun install` needs so the install layer is
# cached independently of source-code edits.
#
# We COPY the whole context (invalidates on any change) then strip everything
# except:
#   - package.json files (every workspace + root)
#   - bun.lock / bun.lockb
#   - patches/* — referenced by `patchedDependencies` in root package.json;
#                 bun install fails immediately if any patch file is missing
#   - .npmrc / .bunfig.toml — registry/auth config, if present
#
# The OUTPUT of this stage is content-addressed: if none of those files change,
# downstream COPY --from=manifests is a cache hit and `bun install` is skipped.

# Rewrite ssh-form GitHub URLs to HTTPS at the system level.  Every flavour
# pnpm / npm / yarn could produce gets normalised to `https://github.com/`:
#
#   git@github.com:owner/repo              → https://github.com/owner/repo
#   ssh://git@github.com/owner/repo        → https://github.com/owner/repo
#   git+ssh://git@github.com/...           → https://github.com/...
#   https://git@github.com:owner/repo      → https://github.com/owner/repo
#   git+https://git@github.com:owner/repo  → https://github.com/owner/repo
#
# The trailing two forms look malformed (`https://` followed by an SSH-style
# colon path) but they're what pnpm's lockfile actually writes for git deps
# in some configurations.  Observed in unleashlive/frontend's pnpm-lock.yaml:
#   version: git+https://git@github.com:unleashlive/ua-gltf-viewer.git#…
#
# Public repos clone unauthenticated; for private repos (e.g. unleashlive
# internal forks declared as deps in the frontend's package.json) the
# per-launch GIT_ASKPASS handler below supplies the Driver's OAuth token at
# git's credential prompt.  Writing to /etc/gitconfig (--system) means the
# rule applies to every UID inside the container — preview launches run as
# uid 10001, not root, so --global wouldn't reach the right HOME.
#
# CRITICAL: we use `--add` for EACH rule because url.<base>.insteadOf is a
# multi-valued key.  Plain `git config key value` (without --add) REPLACES;
# a chain of plain calls leaves only the last entry in /etc/gitconfig.  Bug
# observed in the wild on 2026-05-28: only `git+ssh://git@github.com/` was
# active until the Dockerfile got this fix, so plain `git@github.com:` URLs
# (the form pnpm-lock.yaml resolution.repo uses) weren't being rewritten and
# pnpm install died with "Please make sure you have the correct access
# rights and the repository exists."

# Credential helper for authenticated HTTPS git fetches.  When git needs
# creds (e.g. cloning a private dep over the URL the rewrite above produced),
# it execs $GIT_ASKPASS twice — once for "Username", once for "Password".
# Our helper answers `x-access-token` / `$GITHUB_TOKEN`, which is GitHub's
# canonical OAuth-app HTTP basic-auth form.
#
# Token-flow lifecycle:
#   - Token NEVER lands on disk (only in env at install time)
#   - Token NEVER lands in pnpm-lock.yaml (lockfile sees `https://github.com/`
#     from the rewrite above — the askpass form keeps the URL clean)
